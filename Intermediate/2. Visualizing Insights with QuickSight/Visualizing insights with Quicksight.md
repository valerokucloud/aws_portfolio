In today's data-driven landscape, transforming raw data into meaningful insights is crucial. **AWS QuickSight** and **Amazon S3** provide a powerful combination for building scalable, interactive data visualizations directly from your cloud-stored data.

This guide explores how to connect, prepare, and visualize your datasets using these AWS services. Whether you're a **data analyst**, **developer** , or **business leader** , you'll learn how to leverage QuickSight to create compelling dashboards and make data-driven decisions with ease.


### Steps: 

1. **Data Source**: begin by obtaining your dataset. For example, you can use Spotify data on artists and listeners, which is available on platforms like Kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) 
2. **Creating an S3 bucket and uploading data**: set up an S3 bucket, upload dataset files (listeners.csv and listeners.json) and configure the manifest file.
     * Terraform can't modify a physical JSON file directly, but it can generate one dynamically before uploading it, using jsonencode() or templatefile(). In our case we used templatefile().
        * Therefore, the manifest file "listeners.json" will be renamed "listeners.json.tpl" (temporary file) so that it can be uploaded to the s3 bucket with the bucket's name changed.
3. **Setting up AWS QuickSight**:
 * Creating a new user (in our case we used the free one month version).
  * Check bucket permissions using the options at the top right and selecting "Permissions" + S3 + selecting the bucket:

  * Define a new datasource --> select S3 and define the S3 URI of the manifest file:

  * Once this is done, we will have the dataset defined and can begin with data visualization:

7. Visualizing data on AWS QuickSight:
 * Select the data source details and click on "Visualize":

 * Define an interactive sheet for visualize the data:

 * Select the following:
   * Artist field
   * Filter (more than 75.000.000 listeners, for example)
   * Select a visual chart
