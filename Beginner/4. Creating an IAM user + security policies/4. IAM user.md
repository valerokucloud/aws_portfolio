### You need to complete the following:

  *   Create a new user in IAM with console access.
  *   Add the user to Admin group
      * Create a new group called "Administrators"
      * Add the "AdministratorAccess" managed policy to the new group.
      * Add this new user to the "Admin" group.
  *   Enable MFA for this new user (user process, not available through Terraform).
  *   Apply an IAM password policy that follows security best practices.


### What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a framework of policies, processes, and technologies that ensures the right individuals have the right access to the right resources at the right time — and for the right reasons.
In simpler terms, IAM helps organizations manage digital identities (like users, devices, or services) and control who can access what within their systems.


### What is console access and programmatic access?

*  Console Access:
    * Let users sign in through a web browser (GUI).
    * Uses username + password (and MFA).
    * Used for manual management of cloud resources.

*  Programatic Access:
    * Let users or apps access services via CLI, SDKs, or APIs.
    * Uses Access Key ID + Secret Access Key.
    * Used for automation, scripts, or development.


### What is the access key and secret key?

In cloud IAM (like AWS), an Access Key and Secret Key are a pair of security credentials used for programmatic access — meaning access through the CLI, SDK, or API, not the web console.

Access Key ID:
  * Like a username for programmatic access.
  * Publicly visible in code or configuration files (but should still be protected).
  * Identifies which IAM user or role is making the request.

Example:
AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE

Secret Access Key:
  * Like a password paired with the Access Key ID.
  * Must be kept secret — never shared or stored in code repositories.
  * Used to cryptographically sign requests to verify authenticity.

Example:
wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY


Used Together: when you run a CLI command or make an API call, both keys are used to:
1. Identify who you are (Access Key ID).
2. Prove your identity (Secret Access Key).

Security Best Practices:
  * Never share or hard-code keys in applications.
  * Rotate them regularly.
  * Use IAM roles or temporary credentials when possible.


### What is MFA and why is it important?

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring two or more verification methods to log in — not just a password.

How It Works: to sign in, you provide:
1. Something you know → your password
2. Something you have → a phone app code, hardware token, or SMS code
3. (Optional) Something you are → fingerprint or face ID

Why It’s important:
* Protects accounts if a password is stolen.
* Prevents unauthorized access even if credentials are leaked.
* Helps meet security and compliance requirements.


### What Are Policies?

Policies are rules in IAM that define what actions are allowed or denied for a user, group, or role.
They tell the system: 

“Who can do what, on which resources, and under what conditions.”

Types of Policies
* Managed policies: Reusable and maintained separately (AWS-managed or custom).
* Inline policies: Attached directly to one user, group, or role.


### What Are Policies?

Roles are IAM identities that define a set of permissions (policies) but don’t belong to a specific user.

Instead of having permanent credentials, roles are temporarily assumed by:
* Users
* Applications
* Services (like EC2, Lambda, etc.)


### What is the difference between a role/policy?

Role:
*  A role is an identity that can be assumed by a user, service, or application.
*  It contains permissions through attached policies.
*  It doesn’t have long-term credentials (like passwords or access keys).
*  Used for temporary access or service-to-service interactions.

Policy:
* A policy is a set of rules that define what actions are allowed or denied on which resources.
* It can be attached to a user, group, or role.
* Written in JSON format.

Key difference:

| **Feature**    | **Role**                      | **Policy**                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **What it is** | Identity with permissions     | Document that defines permissions            |
| **Purpose**    | To be assumed by entities     | To grant/deny access                         |
| **Contains**   | One or more policies          | Permissions (actions, resources, conditions) |
| **Used by**    | Users, services, applications | Attached to users, groups, or roles          |


### What is a user group?

A user group in IAM is a way to organize users and assign permissions collectively, instead of attaching permissions to each user individually.
